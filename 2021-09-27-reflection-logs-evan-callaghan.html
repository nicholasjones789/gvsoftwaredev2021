	<h2>Hack Week Time Log - Evan Callaghan</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>	2021-Sept-17: 1 hour: Reading the suggested article about presenting results to an executive. Notes: The foundation of communicating effectively with executives is to have a clear understanding of why you're communicating with them in the first place. It is important to then set a clear agenda for the meeting. However, a great meeting with executive leadership is defined by engaged discussion, not addressing every topic on the agenda. Some mistakes to avoid: never present a question without an answer; avoid academic-style presentations (creating a simple and precise presentation); never fight feedback from the executive.</li><br>
		<li>	2021-Sept-20: 1.5 hours: Reading the suggested article about breaking lazy habits. Notes: When it comes to behavioral “laziness,” we can ask: what are the barriers to action that I can’t see? Understanding the barriers is often the first step to breaking “lazy” behavior patterns. When you don’t fully understand a person’s barriers, it’s easy to impose abstract, rigid expectations on a person’s behavior. Instead of procrastination, when a person fails to begin a project, it’s probably due to either anxiety about their attempts not being “good enough” or confusion about what the first steps of the task are. A few strategies to tackle this are to divide it into smaller tasks, and create a timeline for completion. These are good organizational tools to stay on track. If you look at a person’s action and see only laziness, you are missing key details.</li><br>
