<h2> JacobT's 9/15 </h2>
<h3> Assignment: </h3>
<p> Imagine repeating the past month of software development for 8hrs/day and 5days/wk and 50 weeks/year for the next year. Write down what comes to mind </p>
<br>
<ol>
        <li>The goods:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Being challenged and also learning new skills all the time</li>
        <li>Working with many different people and various skill levels and improving teamwork</li>
        </ul>

        <li>The bads:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Things can often be too challenging and have no time for other things</li>
        <li>Many technical difficulties to get past</li>
        <li>Takes a lot more effort and time than many more areas of work</li>
        <li>Repetitive, tiring to sit there for hours and think through tasks</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
<p>I think that if I were to only be doing this and not managing other classes and a sport and family/friend things, then it could be enjoyable and fun to learn along the way. As of right now, I just have a lot going on and I think it can be stressful </p>
