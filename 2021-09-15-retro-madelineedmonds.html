    <h3>Retro Assignment #1</h3>

    <p>Feelings I have: </p>

    <ol>
        <li>The Pros</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I like the freedom to do what I want to solve the problem</li>
            <li>This improves team working skills from working in person to online exclusive meetings (emails, videos, zoom calls)</li>
        </ul>

        <li>The Cons</li>
        <ul>
            <li>There are so many kinds of technical difficulties that could arise and if not fixed could delay projects for a while.</li>
            <li>Not everyone could be at the same experience level so there can be constraints to how group activities work.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
