<h1> How to write a blog post in html- Morgan Gant and David Beehler</h1>
<h2>Blog html:</h2>
<p>Creating a blog post in HTML only requires a few lines of HTML and since we want everyone’s blog post to look alike, it’s even easier. We would start this page of our website using establishing that we are going to use html by using the  <code><!DOCTYPE html></code> and <code><html lang=en></code>. <br> Then we want to bound a header to our data, within the header we give a title so that the program has a title for the data about to imputed. When the data is outputted, it will not show the title. We then close the head and open the body; this is where a headline statement and blog information will go. Headlines have sizes 1 through 6, 1 being the biggest and 6 being the smallest. An header statement, would be ideal to state what this page of our website entails. For an example, we set this up as if we are blogging our Goals for the semester. So, we named it Software development: Class goals. <br>Then, to separate each person’s goal statement, use another header statement, we could use anywhere between two and six. We suggest two because it’s smaller than the page headline but a little larger than the text so you can clearly see who’s post you’re reading. <br> Then for our main blog post, use a paragraph element, add in all the necessary information and end the statement. 
Anytime we are ending a statement, we will use the original statement starter, ie.  <code><h></code> and add a backslash after the first arrowhead<code></h></code>.

The next person who wants to add a post would just insert a new header statement for their name and a paragraph element under the previous student! We added in an example as if Morgan blogged her Class goals and then Evan did after! <br>
Most of the Student’s goal statements are pretty long and were broken down in paragraphs so we decided to do a little cleaning and add a break statement after each paragraph ended so it would send the next line of the inputted blog information of the paragraph elements to the line below. There are other things we can do to clean up the statements, but that will come from other students! <br>
After all the blogs are written in, we would close the body and html opening statement.

        &lt;h2&gt;Morgan Gant:&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over the summer I took an Intro to Data Science class and it made me want to become a data scientist. I learned that Data Scientists work in teams and the most successful Data Scientists know how each element of their team works. So even though I’m not the most interested in Software development, having knowledge in this area will help me be a better team leader and make my job easier. I also think that having many skills is important so if I can gain software development skills it will make me more well-rounded, a better asset. To make this happen, I want to learn the basics of Software Developing because I know absolutely nothing about it. This includes the different types of software, the history of software, the life cycles, common challenges and any other interesting aspects I learn along the way! This will be the most beneficial if I better my relationships with others in the class. I feel we can learn just as much from our peers as we can a professor, especially when classmates that have personal experience in the field. I have had class with some of these students before but the classes weren’t very interactive so I didn’t get to gauge what knowledge they have to offer. We talked about soft skills like teamwork and communication and the only way to improve on them is to implement them! So, my overall goal is to understand the basics and learn how I can apply it to better myself in my desire of becoming a Data Scientist! &lt;br/&gt;I am a really organized person and work very hard on my schooling. I like to know things ahead of time so I can plan accordingly and I always try to get my work done as early as possible to avoid being stressed. Life does not run on a schedule though, so I know things will change and I will get things thrown at me that might cause panic but if I can accomplish my work in a reasonable timely manner and show my growth throughout the course, I feel that I will be successful no matter what this semester brings. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Evan Callaghan:&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p>For me, success in this class is all about my understanding of the subject matter and being able to take some key ideas away to use in the future. Ideally, I would gain a broad understanding of software development, learn how it is implemented in the real world (workplace), and learn how it can be applied in the field of data analytics. In addition to this, gaining programming experience and improving my soft skills will also help to define success in this course. Working with a team has never been my strong suit, so improving this skill and being able to collaborate with my groupmates will be a great measure for success. &lt;br/&gt;Throughout my time in university, I have found that sometimes the idea of success gets linked to the overall course grade. I have had plenty of courses where I achieved a good course grade but wasn’t able to really utilize or remember the content even a few weeks down the road. Even though I had a good grade, I didn’t learn anything that really stuck with me. On the other hand, my favorite classes and the classes that I’ve enjoyed the most are the ones where I learned every single day. These classes are the ones in which I am always engaged in class, always interested in the course content, and always learn useful content that will help me in my future career. Therefore, to me, success in this software development course looks like: gaining a broad understanding of the subject matter; always trying my best to be engaged in class lectures and discussions; learning about how this content will be helpful in my future career path; and collaborating with teammates/groupmates to build my skills in working as a member of a team. &lt;br/&gt;Within a particular course, there are always specific sections or topics that I struggle with more than others. In these tougher weeks, I am not able to participate as much in class or contribute as much to the conversation. Sometimes, this gives me the impression that other students are having more success than I am. I question why I am struggling so much and become anxious in the classroom. However, I have come to realize that success cannot be measured only the one way. I know that there will be topics that I struggle with, but at the end of the course, it is in achieving my end goals above that will signal whether or not I was successful in the class. Sometimes the impression of success is not always accurate, and success can be measured in many different ways. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
