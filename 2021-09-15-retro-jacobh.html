	<h2> Software Development Retro Assignment: JacobH </h2>	
	<br>
	<p><b> Writing Prompt: Imagine repeating the past month of software development for 8 hrs/day and 5 days/wk and 50 weeks/year for the next year. Wait 30 seconds on the clock, and write out what feelings come up. Write as much as you want.</b></p>

	<p><b> Pros </b></p>
	<ol>
		<br>
		<li> The ability to devot your time to bigger/more challenging/more rewarding projects than is possible while at school.</li>
		<br>
		<li> The need to practice creative solutions to tough problems makes me think that I won't be easily bored while working in software development.</li>
		<br>
		<li> I enjoy when I can break down a problem into smaller and smaller problems and implement solutions to solve each of those organized sub-problems. Which lends itself to software development well.</li>  
		<br>
		<li> I enjoy the work.</li>
		<br>
		<li> The ability to potentially work remotely is honestly a big plus too.</li>
		<br>
	</ol>
	
	<p><b> Cons </b></p>
	<ol>
		<br>
		<li> Dealing with the stress of constantly learning new things</li>
		<br>
		<li> Having to think of solutions and be mentally focused on a problem for a long period of time (not really being able to afford an "off-day")</li>
		<br>
		
	</ol>
	<p><b> Conclusion: I think that I would like to work as a software developer. I was a bit apprehensive but I have really enjoyed my internship as a developer and it did a lot to ease my anxieties about the job. I think that the problem solving and learning aspect which can be stressful also keep the work interesting and leave me thinking about problems even when I am off the clock.</b></p>
	
	<p>I feel like doing software development for 8 hours a day,  5 days a week, and 50 weeks a year for the next year could be a little stressful. I think that constantly having to learn new things and think through new problems could be a source of stress on a day that you just aren’t “with it”. However, in some ways I think that I would enjoy it more than going to school for computer science. Having to work day in and day out means that you are bound to become familiar with your job and the problem solving, technical ability, and daily task management would likely get easier as you gain experience. I know even just while working at my internship that having a steady project that I am contributing to over time is more encouraging to me because I can see real progress and the big picture of a project. Whereas in school most assignments are usually independent of one another without an overarching theme (again, only usually). I prefer seeing the big picture come together, as you can while working consistently on a large project like you could at a real job.</p>
	
	<p>So, I think in summation, that while the idea of doing this work full time has stressful elements, there are also elements that are reassuring. I would like the ability to stick with something for a long time and become confident working with a given project. On the flipside, I will probably be a little stressed out while trying to prove to myself and others that I really do know what I am doing. I think in some ways I still feel like I am brand new to programming and don’t know anything at all. So, it will be nice to have some concrete experience that I can use to remind myself that I can do this job and do it well.</p>
